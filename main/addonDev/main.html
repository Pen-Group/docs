<h1 class="centered">Pen+ Addon Dev</h1>

<p>
    If you want to develop a Pen+ addon you can get the Pen+ addon api <a href="https://github.com/Pen-Group/extensions/blob/main/apis/penPlusAddon.js">here</a>!<br>
    All you have to do is put this in with your extension and then you have a new variable called penPlus! This will let you grab info from the extension.
