    This is where 3d Gurus get excited. The triangle blocks contain many helpful utilities for drawing triangles.<br>
    Though this set of blocks only exists for singular triangles.

<h2>
  "set triangle point [point]'s [attribute] to [value]"
</h2>

<info-box color="#00FF95">Some attributes only effect textured triangles. Ones with a (T) at the beginning are those ones.</info-box>

<p>
This block sets the attribute of the desired point on the triangle to the value desired. Even individual components of tints can be changed.<br>
<img style="height: 196px; width: 196px;" src="main/extensions/penPlus/images/triangleExample.png"><br>
The different attributes include.
<ul>
  <li>(T)U value - The  horizontal point of the texture this point of the triangle samples from. UV's are a 0-1 range!</li>

  <li>(T)V value - The vertical point of the texture this point of the triangle samples from. UV's are a 0-1 range!</li>

  <li>Red Tint - Changes the amount of red that shows through a 1-100 range.</li>
  <li>Green Tint - Changes the amount of green that shows through a 1-100 range.</li>
  <li>Blue Tint - Changes the amount of blue that shows through a 1-100 range.</li>
  <li>Transparency - Sets the transparency of the point will be interpolated to the other points.</li>
  
  <li>Corner Pinch - Squishes the attributes of a point more to that corner relative to the other points.<br> 
    <img style="height: 196px; width: 196px;" src="main/extensions/penPlus/images/cornerPinchExample.png">
  </li>

  <li>Depth Value - Sets the depth in which the point will be rendered. Good for layering, or 3d effects.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br>

<h2>
  "set triangle's [attribute] to [value]"
</h2>
<img src="main/extensions/penPlus/blocks/triangleBlocks/setTriangleAttribute.svg" alt=""></img>
<p>
This block sets the attributes of a whole triangle more limited than setting each point individually.
<ul>
  <li>Red Tint - Changes the amount of red that shows through a 1-100 range.</li>
  <li>Green Tint - Changes the amount of green that shows through a 1-100 range.</li>
  <li>Blue Tint - Changes the amount of blue that shows through a 1-100 range.</li>
  <li>Transparency - Sets the transparency of the point will be interpolated to the other points.</li>
  <li>Depth Value - Sets the depth in which the point will be rendered. Good for layering, or 3d effects.</li>
</ul>
